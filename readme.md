# Algorithmic-Folding Work in Progress branch
The code base for the Algorithmic Folding class.

## General Advice
1. Never push to `master`
2. For each branch, add a section "*How to Run*" in the `readme.md` that explains, how to run the code
3. Write imperative commit messages, that would finish the sentence "If applied, this commit will ` Change the behaviour of class x`."
4. Describe what was done and why, but not how

## How to Run
simply run the .py file with a python 3 interpreter
