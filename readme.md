# SVG creation tool
This tool will convert a design in Cinderella into a PDF so that it can be laser cut.
Note that the tool only works if all connections are created as segments!

#How to Run
Copy the contents of the SVG_creation files in Cinderella to the Editor -> Events -> Drawing (this can be opened with ctrl+9) Now the linkages should be created. All elements will be made invisible, so that the file can be exported as pdf immediately. This can be done for example with a button in the lower left corner. If changes are to be made to the design, you can display all invisible elements by clicking on a button in the lower menu bar.
Gridlines have to be deactivated, so that it can be directly lasercut
