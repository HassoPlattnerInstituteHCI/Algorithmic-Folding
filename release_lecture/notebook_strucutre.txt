notebook 1:

	provide a structure for them to implement this:
		pick wing direction
		divide into strips and wings
	have a way to check if it worked...

notebook 2:
	
	provide solution to notebook 1
	provide a structure for them to implement this:
		generate multiple strips
		rate them

notebook 3:
	
	provide solution to notebook 2
	provide a structure for them to implement this:
		create the tree out of the strip for a cube
		unfolding
		do an overlap check for the faces
	draw the strip...

notebook 4:
	
	provide solution to notebook 3
	provide a structure for them to implement this:
		attach the wings (basic way)
		if you have longest edge implemented, it goes here
	draw the strip...

notebook 5:
	
	provide solution to notebook 4

notebook 6:

	introduce the l shape
	provide a structure for them to implement this:
		create a recursive call to this
		catch faces that are disconnected or overlap
	
notebook 7:
	
	provide solution to notebook 6

notebook_assaignment:

    heuristics tree_root

	introduce the chair
	provide a structure for them to implement this:
		wing heuristics
    
	introduce the diamond or something shape
	provide a structure for them to implement this:
		deal with faces that have non 90 deg normals
